I am a software developer currently studying mathematics at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I've been leading open source projects and sysadmin work at [Mine in Abyss](https://mineinabyss.com) for over 5 years.

I recently completed a work term as a backend developer at [Sensei Labs](https://www.senseilabs.com/). My personal projects include [Geary](https://github.com/MineInAbyss/Geary), a fast entity component system written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), past [game jam submissions](https://github.com/0ffz/Ludum-Dare-46), and more on my GitHub.

In my spare time, I've been learning the piano, trying to find a use for my home server, and getting dangerously close to purchasing [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/).
